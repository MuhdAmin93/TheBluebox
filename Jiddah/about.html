    <h1> About Us</h1>
    <p>How about a story? Well I won't call it short but here it goes... A long, long time ago, I hated cooking, baking, whatever it was as long as I had to enter the kitchen. My sister on the other hand loved everthing about being in the kitchen (she still does). She made all these foods and delicious cakes for every special occassions. I was the one who loved fashion yup! The fashionista. I watched all sorts of fashion channels and makeover shows and I loved every bit of it. Fast forward to 4 years ago I started joining my sister to watch a food channel called food network and obviously I preferred the baking shows and competitions. I started enjoying them bit by bit and before I knew it I fell in love with the baking, the decorations and all the art involved in it. I fell in love but that wasn't the interesting part.It didn't motivate me to make it into a business. Rather I used up all my mum's eggs and sugar to try all these recipes I saw on TV. And my mum being the angel she was tried all the rubbish I made, both edible and non edible. God bless that woman! Here's the interesting part...My mum loves sugar and she spent money on all these cakes and pastries. And I thought "Why spend all this money outside when I can make all of it? ", that was the motivation. And I said "Imma start this business! what should I name it? "Whatever it was, I wanted 'Blue' in it, because I love that color with all my heart and everybody knew it! The Blue Shop? No, Blue's Bakery? No, Blue's Bakes? No, Bluebox.... Yes I found it BlueBox! So we started with Bluuebox Cakes, then BlueBox Shop and finally BlueBox Shop. </p>
